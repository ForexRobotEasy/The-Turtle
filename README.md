# Turtle EA

The Turtle EA is a forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This EA is designed for efficient long-term trading and can be used on multiple currency pairs. The code provided demonstrates the main functions and operations of the Turtle EA.

## Position Size Calculation Function

The `CalculatePositionSize` function calculates the position size based on the risk percentage and stop loss level. It takes two parameters: `riskPercentage` and `stopLoss`. The function first retrieves the account balance using the `AccountBalance()` function. It then calculates the risk amount by multiplying the account balance by the risk percentage divided by 100. Finally, the position size is calculated by dividing the risk amount by the stop loss level. The function returns the position size.

## Risk Percentage Calculation Function

The `CalculateRiskPercentage` function calculates the risk percentage based on the stop loss level. It takes one parameter: `stopLoss`. Similar to the `CalculatePositionSize` function, it retrieves the account balance using `AccountBalance()`. It also defines a maximum risk percentage per trade (`maxRiskPercentage`). The function calculates the risk percentage by multiplying the stop loss level by 100 and dividing it by the account balance. If the calculated risk percentage exceeds the maximum risk percentage, it is set to the maximum value. The function returns the risk percentage.

## Trading Strategy Adaptation Function

The `AdaptTradingStrategy` function adapts the trading strategy based on market conditions for optimal performance. It checks the current year using the `Year()` function and compares it to the best performance year (2023 in this example). If the current year is equal to or greater than the best performance year, the necessary code to adapt the trading strategy should be implemented within the function.

## Trade Execution Functions

The code provides two trade execution functions: `ExecuteTradeXAUUSD` and `ExecuteTradeUSDCHF`. These functions should contain the necessary code to execute trades on the respective currency pairs (XAUUSD and USDCHF) using the developed trading strategy. The implementation of these functions is not included in the provided code.

## Commission Calculation Function

The `CalculateCommissionUSDCHF` function calculates and manages commission costs for trades on the USDCHF pair. It takes one parameter: `tradeVolume`. The necessary code to calculate the commission is not included in the provided code, and a placeholder value of 0.0 is assigned to the `commission` variable. This function should be implemented to accurately calculate the commission based on the trade volume.

## Main Program

The `OnTick` function is the main program that demonstrates the usage of the developed functions. It provides an example usage of the `CalculateRiskPercentage` and `CalculatePositionSize` functions to calculate the risk percentage and position size for the XAUUSD and USDCHF pairs. The `AdaptTradingStrategy` function is called to adapt the trading strategy based on market conditions. The `ExecuteTradeXAUUSD` and `ExecuteTradeUSDCHF` functions are called to execute trades on the respective currency pairs. The `CalculateCommissionUSDCHF` function is called to calculate the commission for USDCHF trades. Other necessary operations can be continued after these function calls.
